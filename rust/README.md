The `fincore.py` in the root of the repository is a Python financial library.

The `rust/fincore.rs` should be an accurate translation of this Python file into Rust

To build the library from the root directory, use the `--manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml` command line option.

    cargo build --manifest-path=rust/Cargo.toml
